### Example Questions

Tailor these to your agent's configuration:

- "How do I [common customer task]?"
- "What are your hours of operation?"

### Common Demo Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Microphone doesn't work | Make sure you're on **HTTPS** (Heroku provides this) |
| App is slow to load | Free Heroku dynos sleep - visit URL before demo |
| Agent gives wrong answer | Review and improve your agent's topics/instructions |
| No audio playback | Check browser audio permissions |

## üé® Customization

### Change Your Agent

Just update the environment variable (no code changes needed):

```bash
heroku config:set SALESFORCE_AGENT_ID=new_agent_id
```

The app immediately uses the new agent!

### Change the Voice

Edit `server/routes.ts` around line 207:

```typescript
const { text, voice = 'allison' } = req.query; // Change to 'onyx', 'shimmer', etc.
```

Available voices:
- `allison` - Millennial female (default, conversational)
- `onyx` - Strong male (professional)
- `shimmer` - Clear male (friendly)
- `echo` - Deep male (authoritative)
- `nova` - Expressive female (enthusiastic)
