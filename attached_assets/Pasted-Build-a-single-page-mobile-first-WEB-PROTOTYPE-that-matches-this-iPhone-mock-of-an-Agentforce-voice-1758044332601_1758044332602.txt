Build a single page, mobile-first WEB PROTOTYPE that matches this iPhone mock of an Agentforce voice app. Produce ONE file only: index.html containing complete HTML with embedded CSS and minimal vanilla JS. No external libraries, no CDNs, no build tools. Do not ask questions. Return the full code.

Layout
- Top centered title: “Agentforce”.
- Large white card with 24px corner radius and soft shadow.
- Inside the card, vertically centered: big mic icon, headline “Talk to AgentForce”, subtext “Hold the button below to talk to AgentForce.”
- Primary round mic button centered below that, diameter 72px, bright blue. Label under it: “Hold to speak”.
- Below the card: a row of three circular action buttons spaced evenly:
  - Left: red end button
  - Middle: gray mute toggle
  - Right: blue profile button
- Bottom tab bar with three items: Voice (active), History, Settings. Voice is highlighted.

Visual spec
- Background: soft vertical gradient #F2F6FF to #FFFFFF with generous padding that respects iOS safe areas.
- Font: system-ui, -apple-system, "SF Pro Text", sans-serif.
- Colors: Title #1E40AF. Headline #0F172A. Subtext #475569 at 80% opacity.
- Card shadow: rgba(2,23,61,0.08) 0 8px 24px.
- Mic icon container at top of card: 80px circle, background #EEF2FF, mic glyph #3B82F6.
- Primary mic button: blue vertical gradient #3B82F6 to #2563EB with inner glow and white mic glyph. Label below in 14px.
- Action buttons: 56px circles.
  - End: gradient #EF4444 to #DC2626 with white phone-down icon
  - Mute: #E5E7EB with dark gray mic-off icon that toggles blue when unmuted
  - Profile: #2563EB with white avatar icon
- Tab bar: frosted glass look with backdrop-filter blur, rounded 20px container. Active item blue icon and label, inactive gray.

Interactions
- Press and hold on the big mic button:
  - On pointerdown or touchstart: start a pulsing ring animation around the button, scale button to 0.96, change label to “Listening…”
  - On pointerup or touchend: stop pulse, scale back to 1, label returns to “Hold to speak”
- Mute button toggles icon and aria-pressed state.
- Tabs switch simple content panes client side without reloading the page.

Accessibility
- All buttons have aria-labels and visible focus outlines.
- Minimum text contrast 4.5:1.
- Use prefers-reduced-motion to disable animations for users who prefer it.

Dark mode
- Support prefers-color-scheme: dark.
- Background gradient becomes #0B1220 to #0E1426.
- Card becomes #0F172A with appropriate text colors.
- Blues shift slightly lighter for readability, for example labels #60A5FA.

Implementation details
- Use inline SVG for all icons.
- Use CSS variables at the top for colors, radii, and shadows.
- Use a simple 8px spacing scale.
- Ensure it is responsive down to 320px width and centered up to 430px. Main card max-width 360px.
- Add a subtle ripple around the mic while pressed using keyframes on two concentric pseudo elements.

Success criteria
- The result looks like a polished iOS screen, not a wireframe.
- The mic button shows an animated pulse while pressed.
- A frosted tab bar with Voice active is present.
- History and Settings show placeholder views when tapped.
